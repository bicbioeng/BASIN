# BASIN
An R package that utilizes Shiny to provide a user interface
for statistical analysis of two-dimensional confocal microscope images. Users
can upload two images directly or a folder of images with the help of a
user-generated csv file, edit their experimental design, create tables and
graphs for analysis results, and generate a fully-formatted report of their
experiment.

# tryBASIN Overview and Quick Tutorial
The tryBASIN application is a version of BASIN that's available online at [https://basin.bicbioeng.org/](https://basin.bicbioeng.org/). This version takes in 2 images and serves as a gentle tutorial to most of BASIN's features. We have provided sample images in the application for users to get familiar with the workflow. Users can also upload their own images to test out using tryBASIN.

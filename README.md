# BASIN
An R package that utilizes Shiny to provide a user interface
for statistical analysis of two-dimensional confocal microscope images. Users
can upload two images directly or a folder of images with the help of a
user-generated csv file, edit their experimental design, create tables and
graphs for analysis results, and generate a fully-formatted report of their
experiment.

## Installation and Usage
Details on the features and functionality of BASIN can be found in the BASIN
vignette, which is accessible through the package itself. To install BASIN
in R, download the tarball file BASIN_0.99.0.tar.gz into your local machine
and use the command install.packages("path/to/BASIN"), replacing the
"path/to/BASIN" with the location of the file. Once installed, load the
package using library(BASIN). The package vignette can be accessed using the
command browseVignettes("BASIN") and will contain further instructions on
using the package.
